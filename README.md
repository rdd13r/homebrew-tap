# Homebrew Tap

This project is a list of formulae for exposing Varabyte artifacts to Homebrew.

## Formulae
Install a formula either by listing the tap path explicitly:

```sh
$ brew install varabyte/tap/<formula>
```

Or by installing our tap (you only need to do this once):

```sh
$ brew tap varabyte/tap
$ brew install <formula>
```
